The paper defines **minhash** in the context of database profiling for estimating field similarity. Here's the extracted definition and explanation from the text:

### ðŸ“Œ **Definition of Minhash (as per the paper):**

> A **minhash sketch** is a collection of $K$ values computed by:
>
> $$
> mi(f) = \min(h_i(v_j) \mid \text{over all values } v_j \text{ of field } f)
> $$
>
> for $i$ ranging from 1 to $K$, and each $h_i$ is a different hash function.

### ðŸ“Š **How Minhash Is Used:**

The **resemblance** between two fields $f$ and $g$ (denoted as $\text{res}(f, g)$) is approximated by:

$$
\text{res}(f, g) = \frac{1}{K} \sum_{i=1}^K \text{ if }(mi(f) = mi(g), 1, 0)
$$

This allows fast approximation of **Jaccard similarity** between sets of field values.

### âœ… **Applications of Minhash Sketches in This Paper:**

* **Finding join paths** between tables.
* **Imputing metadata** from one field to another by identifying similar content.
* **Efficient similarity search** in large datasets.

Let me know if you want an illustrative example or how this technique is implemented in their schema linking system.
